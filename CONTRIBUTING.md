## Contributing


### Package Name
- Set package name as `com.drax.xyz` where `xyz` is somewhat descriptive of the app functionality.
- For example, if you are creating a text editor, a good package name would be `com.drax.textedit`.

### Commits
- Try to keep commits as atomic as possible.
- Since there are multiple apps, use the format `AppName: Description of changes` as the commit message.
